			So I loooooooove to eat. I eat alooooot. I eat probably 5 meals a day. Once for breakfast, once for lunch, another meal in the later afternoon, once for dinner, and a second dinner around midnight (but its not midnight snack because its too big for a snack). <br><br>

	I like to cook too. On rare occaisions I'll eat out when I'm lazy, or with friends. But mainly, I'm my own cook! My mom has made homecooked meals my entire life, and has always preached eating healthy, eating vegetables, and eating at home. I like to be in control of my eating destiny! <br> <br>

	This will be a place for pictures of random food I'm proud of making, and "recipes" of how I made it. Honestly, it won't be super precise because I never use measuring devices and alot of ingredients are optional. I'm not the best cook, but it'll be nice to document these things. Cheers for happy cooking, happy eating!
